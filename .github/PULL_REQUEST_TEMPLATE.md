## Checklist for updating translations

There are two situations in which we create manual PRs to update translations:

1. We don't want to wait for Travis's automatic weekly update; or,
2. We need to add a language that has become ready

### 1. Updating translations manually

- [ ] Pull editor translations from Transifex with `> npm run pull:editor`
- [ ] Pull www translations from Transifex with `> npm run pull:www`
- [ ] Test the result with `> npm run test`
- [ ] Confirm that you see changes to files like `editor/<resource>/<lang code>.json`

### Adding a language

- [ ] Edit `src/supported-locales.mjs`:

  - [ ] Add entry for the language in the `locales` const
  - [ ] Check if language is right-to-left. If so:
    - Add entry in `rtlLocales`

- [ ] Check if the new language uses a country code

  - Check [https://www.transifex.com/explore/languages](https://www.transifex.com/explore/languages). If the language has a country code:
  - [ ] Edit `src/supported-locales.mjs`:
    - Add new entry to `localeMap`. Format is `'<W3C HTML browser locale string>': '<Transifex ICU locale string>'`
  - [ ] Edit `.tx/config`:
    - Add to the `lang_map` list. Format is `<Transifex ICU locale string>:<W3C HTML browser locale string>`
    - NOTE: we are moving away from using the `tx` cli; `.tx/config` will eventually be deprecated

- [ ] Edit `src/index.js`:

  - [ ] Add 'import' line
  - [ ] Add entry in `localeData` array

- [ ] Check if locale is in `react-intl`

  - Look in [https://unpkg.com/react-intl/locale-data/](https://unpkg.com/react-intl/locale-data/)
  - If not in `react-intl`:
    - [ ] Edit `src/supported-locales.mjs`:
      - In `customLocales`, add entry with parent set to a `react-intl` locale
    - [ ] Edit `src/index.js`:
      - In `localeData`, add entry for parent locale

- [ ] Update translations per the "Updating translations" section above
- [ ] Confirm that we see changes to:

  - [ ] `src/supported-locales.mjs`
  - [ ] `src/index.js`
  - [ ] `.tx/config` (if language needed a new locale)
  - [ ] Multiple files like `editor/<resource>/<lang code>.json`

- [ ] Bump minor version number in `package.json`

- [ ] **Add language po files to scratchr2_translations**

  - manually update `scratchr2_translations/legacy` with `tx pull -l <locale>` and check in changes

- [ ] **Add language to scratchr2 settings**
  - manually update `settings/base.py` with the new language

#### After scratch-l10n update is published:

- [ ] **Update scratch-blocks dependency**
  - [ ] in `package.json`, update the version of the scratch-l10n dependency to the version number you used above
  - [ ] pull translations so that a new `Blockly.ScratchMsgs.locales["<LOCALE CODE>"]` is added to `msg/scratch_msgs.js`
