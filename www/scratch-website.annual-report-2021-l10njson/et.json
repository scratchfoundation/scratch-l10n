    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP1": "In 2021, COVID-19 continued to disrupt our routines and shape the way we interact with one another. Even as we began to gather together, schools reopened, and there were calls for a “return to normal,” the most vulnerable in our society remained disproportionately impacted by the inequitable structures that COVID-19 exacerbated. The COVID-19 crisis shaped young people’s relationships to Scratch, and solidified Scratch as a more vital place than ever for them to create, learn, and connect. But as we moved into a new year, we did not leave behind our most vulnerable young people as they began to navigate “the new normal.”",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP2": "One of the foundational values of Scratch has always been to empower young people to explore, create, play, and discover—opportunities that aren’t afforded equitably to all students.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessagePullquote": "We believe in the transformative power of self-expression and creativity, and in providing space for young people to use creative coding as a tool to raise their voice.",

    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP4": "Last year was an incredible year for the Scratch Foundation–we focused on growing our team with remarkable, diverse leaders and building a solid foundation for our continued transition to an independent organization. We developed a three-year Strategic Plan with the combined efforts of every team member at every level of our organization, codifying the work we’re embarking on together. As Scratch grows, we remain focused on equity and community-building, and keeping Scratch a safe space for kids to connect, create, and collaborate with their peers around the world.",
    "annualReport.2021.directorsMessageP5": "I can’t thank you enough for embarking on this journey with our team, and for your continued support of our mission.

This global impact is possible because of the tireless work of the growing team of engineers, designers, educators, community moderators, and others at the Scratch Foundation.",

    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText3": "My research group at the MIT Media Lab started collaborating with the LEGO company and LEGO Foundation more than 30 years ago. LEGO funding helped support our early work on Scratch, leading up to the public launch of Scratch in 2007. Then, when Scratch spun out of MIT into the Scratch Foundation in 2019, the LEGO Foundation provided important funding for the new organization, with a five-year $10 million grant to “support transformative educational change by developing and promoting playful, creative approaches to coding...in diverse economic and cultural contexts.” When the pandemic hit, the LEGO Foundation stepped up with an additional $5 million grant in 2021, to ensure that the Scratch Foundation could meet the needs of children and educators disrupted by the pandemic.",
    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText4": "But the LEGO-Scratch connection goes far beyond financial support. The Scratch approach of creating animated stories and games by snapping together graphical programming blocks was inspired, in part, by the way children build LEGO houses and castles by snapping together plastic LEGO bricks. Scratch and LEGO also share the same project-based educational philosophy, encouraging children to iteratively refine their projects by trying out an idea, seeing what happens, then making revisions and trying again.",
    "annualReport.2021.FounderMessageText5": "I’ve always loved the LEGO slogan “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation.” The LEGO Foundation’s deep partnership with the Scratch Foundation is helping to bring “Joy of Building, Pride of Creation” to children’s digital activities.
