    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP1": "2020年将被铭记为COVID-19疫情席卷全球的一年，给每个人的生活带来困难和干扰——最大的困难不公平地落在那些已经面临生活挑战的人们身上。",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP2": "在整个疫情期间，世界各地的年轻人——许多在家里隔离的人——来到了Scratch网站，人数比以往任何时候都多。他们将Scratch视为一个安全的空间，可以创造性地表达自己，学习新技能，并相互协作。我们被年轻人在2020年期间创建的许多Scratch项目所鼓舞，其中许多人分享了他们对病毒、气候变化、种族不公正和其他在脑海中的问题的想法和感受。年轻人不仅在学习计算概念和技能，还在发展他们的发言和身份。",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP3": "To ensure that Scratch can continue to play this important role in young people’s lives in the years ahead, we’ve been making significant organizational changes at Scratch. At the start of 2020, the Scratch Team moved out of its longtime home at the MIT Media Lab and into the new offices of the Scratch Foundation in downtown Boston. This move will help us to build a sustainable organization capable of supporting Scratch as a global creative coding platform into the future.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP4": "Later in 2020, as part of this organizational transition, we hired Shawna Young to serve as Executive Director of the Scratch Foundation. Shawna comes to the Scratch Foundation with a strong background in education and nonprofit management, and a deep commitment to equity and inclusion. Throughout her career in institutions such as Duke and MIT, Shawna has worked to expand learning experiences for students from diverse communities. That commitment is strongly aligned with Scratch’s mission and values, and it will play an important role in her leadership at Scratch. I encourage you to read Shawna’s message at the end of this annual report.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP5": "Over the past decade, Scratch has had phenomenal success, engaging tens of millions of young people around the world. But we are just beginning. The challenge for the years ahead is to ensure that we can continue to spread and support not just our technology but also our creative, caring, collaborative learning approach, so that young people around the world have equitable opportunities to imagine, create, share, and learn. We look forward to working with all of you to make that happen!",
