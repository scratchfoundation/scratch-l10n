    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP1": "L'any 2020 serà recordat com l'any en què la pandèmia de la COVID va arrasar el món, causant dificultats i interrupcions en la vida de tothom, i les majors dificultats van recaure de manera desigual sobre aquells que ja s'enfrontaven a reptes a les seves vides.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP2": "Durant la pandèmia, joves d'arreu del món, molts aïllats a casa seva, han vingut al lloc web de Scratch en nombre més gran que mai, veient Scratch com un espai segur on poden expressar-se creativament, aprendre noves habilitats i col·laborar entre ells. Ens van inspirar molts dels projectes de Scratch que els joves van crear durant el 2020, molts d'ells compartint els seus pensaments i sentiments sobre la pandèmia, el canvi climàtic, la injustícia racial i altres temes que els preocupen. Els joves no només aprenien conceptes i habilitats computacionals, sinó que també desenvolupaven la seva veu i les seves identitats.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP3": "Per garantir que Scratch pugui continuar jugant aquest paper important en la vida dels joves en els propers anys, hem estat fent canvis organitzatius significatius a Scratch. A principis del 2020, l'equip de Scratch es va traslladar de la seva seu de tota la vida al MIT Media Lab a les noves oficines de la Scratch Foundation al centre de Boston. Aquest trasllat ens ajudarà a construir una organització sostenible capaç de donar suport a Scratch com a plataforma global de codificació creativa en el futur.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP4": "Més tard, el 2020, com a part d'aquesta transició organitzativa, vam contractar Shawna Young per exercir de directora executiva de la Fundació Scratch. Shawna arriba a la Fundació Scratch amb una sòlida experiència en educació i gestió d'organitzacions sense ànim de lucre, i un profund compromís amb l'equitat i la inclusió. Al llarg de la seva carrera en institucions com Duke i el MIT, Shawna ha treballat per ampliar les experiències d'aprenentatge per a estudiants de comunitats diverses. Aquest compromís està fortament alineat amb la missió i els valors de Scratch, i tindrà un paper important en el seu lideratge a Scratch. Us animo a llegir el missatge de Shawna al final d'aquest informe anual.",
    "annualReport.2020.foundersMessageP5": "Durant l'última dècada, Scratch ha tingut un èxit fenomenal, involucrant desenes de milions de joves d'arreu del món. Però tot just estem començant. El repte per als propers anys és garantir que puguem continuar difonent i donant suport no només a la nostra tecnologia, sinó també al nostre enfocament d'aprenentatge creatiu, solidari i col·laboratiu, de manera que els joves d'arreu del món tinguin oportunitats equitatives per imaginar, crear, compartir i aprendre.

    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageTitle": "A Message from Our Executive Director",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText1": "2020 was a transformational year around the world, and for Scratch. I joined the team in November, when we were months into the COVID-19 pandemic. With my background as an educational leader, I was excited about the potential of leading Scratch through a period of significant change and continuing to work toward my personal goal of helping students from all backgrounds reach new heights. I knew that in this challenging year, young people everywhere were in serious need of even more support to help them achieve their potential.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText2": "The inequitable structures we have built to educate children were exacerbated by the pandemic. Through our conversations with families and educators from around the world, we know that in 2020, kids from all communities needed creative learning opportunities to express their ideas and build their skills more than ever, even while many of them did not have the ability to go to school.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText3": "As the world adapted and approached creative learning and self expression in new ways, many educators, parents, and young people turned to Scratch. We saw 40% more Scratchers creating projects year over year, and Scratchers left 200% more comments in 2020 than in 2019. Young people from all around the world used Scratch as a place to connect, converse, collaborate, and engage with one another. We saw them discover the amazing things they could create when they were given the opportunity to think creatively and solve problems they were passionate about. ",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText4": "In the wake of the pandemic, some have called for a “return to normal.” But for many young people, the freedom to learn and explore was missing in our schools well before COVID-19.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessagePullQuote": "We must do everything we can to change the systemic inequities in our educational systems, because “normal” was not built to be fair and equitable for most of our children.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText5": "In 2021, Scratch is redoubling our efforts to reach young people who have been historically excluded from creative computing and other creative learning opportunities. With support from Google.org, we’ve launched the Scratch Education Collaborative (SEC), a powerful network of organizations across the world focused on supporting these learners in developing their confidence in creative computing. The 41 organizations in year one of the new program will connect with and learn from the Scratch Team and one another, and develop Equity Toolkits that will support them as they grow and scale their support for the learners in their community.",
    "annualReport.2020.EDMessageText6": "Our work to make Scratch even more equitable and inclusive is far from over. I’m excited to share more with you in the coming months. Until then, I’d like to extend my sincere appreciation to the Scratch Community for continuing to support and care for each other through a turbulent year. Your creativity and compassion never ceases to inspire us.",
