    "faq.uploadOldBody": "Yes: You can share or upload projects made with earlier versions of Scratch, and they will be visible and playable. (However, you can’t download projects made with or edited in later versions of Scratch and open them in earlier versions. For example, you can’t open a Scratch 3.0 project in the desktop version of {scratch2Link}, because Scratch 2.0 doesn’t know how to read the .sb3 project file format.)",

    "faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Title": "Why are the blocks bigger in Scratch 3.0 than in earlier versions?",
    "faq.biggerBlocksScratch3Body": "In order to make Scratch 3.0 work well on touch devices (like many Chromebooks, Windows Surface laptops, and tablets), we needed to make the blocks bigger, so that it’s easier to drag and tap the blocks. In addition, blocks are slightly bigger in Scratch 3.0 to help address issues we observed with new users having trouble clicking and dragging small interface elements.",
    "faq.extensionsScratch3Title": "Where did the Pen blocks go? Where did the Music blocks go? Where did the Video Sensing blocks go?",

    "faq.remixDefinitionTitle": "Hvad er et remix?",
    "faq.remixDefinitionBody": "Hvis en Scratcher laver en kopi af en andens projekt og ændrer den for at tilføje egne idéer (for eksempel ved at ændre scripts eller skifte kostymer), kaldes resultatet for et \"remix\". Hver delt projekt på Scratch websiden kan remixes. Vi betragter selv en mindre ændring at være en gyldig remix, så længe der gives anerkendelse til den som har lavet det oprindelige projekt og andre, og andre som har lavet væsentlige bidrag til remixen.",
    "faq.remixableTitle": "Hvorfor kræver Scratch Teamet at alle projekter kan \"remixes\"?",
    "faq.remixableBody": "We believe that remixing other people’s projects is a great way to learn to program and to create interesting projects. Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.",
    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle": "Hvad hvis jeg ikke vil have at andre bygger videre på mine projekter?",
    "faq.creativeCommonsBody": "Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.",
    "faq.fairUseTitle": "Kan jeg bruge billeder / lyde / andre medier fra internettet i mine projekter?",
    "faq.fairUseBody": "If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the {ccLink}.",

    "faq.whyAccountTitle": "Why is it useful to have a Scratch account?",
    "faq.whyAccountBody": "Even without an account, you can play other people’s projects, read comments and forums, and even create your own projects. But you need an account to save and share projects, write comments and forum posts, and participate in other \"social\" activities in the community (like \"loving\" other people’s projects).",
    "faq.createAccountTitle": "Hvordan kan jeg lave en konto?",
    "faq.createAccountBody": "Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",
    "faq.checkConfirmedTitle": "Hvordan kan jeg se, om min konto er blevet bekræftet?",
    "faq.howToConfirmTitle": "Hvordan sletter jeg min konto?",
    "faq.howToConfirmBody": "After you create a new account on Scratch, you’ll receive an email message with a link. Just click the link to confirm your account. Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there. Please note that it may take up to an hour for the email to arrive. If you still don't see the email after an hour, {contactLink}.",
    "faq.contactLinkText": "lad os det vide",
    "faq.checkConfirmedBody": "To check whether your account is confirmed, login to your Scratch account and go to your {settingsLink} page. Confirmed email addresses will show a small green checkmark. Otherwise, you will see the text \"Your email address is unconfirmed\" in orange.",

    "faq.newScratcherTitle": "Hvordan overgår jeg fra 'Ny Scratcher' til 'Scratcher'?",
    "faq.newScratcherBody": "Når du opretter en konto, får du mærkatet “Ny Scratcher“. For at blive “Scratcher“ skal du lave og dele projekter, kommentere opmuntrende på andre scratcheres projekter og være tålmodig! Efter du har mødt kravene, dukker et link op på din profil med en invitation til at blive Scratcher, og du vil få flere muligheder på Scratch hjemmesiden. (Bemærk, at vi ikke gør nye scratchere til scratchere på forespørgsel.)",
    "faq.multipleAccountTitle": "Kan jeg have mere end en konto?",
    "faq.multipleAccountBody": "It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.",
    "faq.multipleLoginTitle": "Er det OK at mere end en person er logget ind på en konto?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody": "This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle": "Kan jeg ændre mit brugernavn?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody": "The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to switch to a new username, you can make a new account, but you'll have to copy your projects over to the new account on your own.",
    "faq.shareInfoTitle": "Hvilke informationer kan jeg dele på / og med min konto?",
    "faq.shareInfoBody": "Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website. Please report projects, comments, or forum posts that contain this kind of information, so the Scratch Team can remove the information, and remind the author of our policy against sharing personal contact information.",
    "faq.deleteAccountTitle": "Hvordan sletter jeg min konto?",
    "faq.deleteAccountBody": "Login to Scratch, and then click your username in the top right-hand corner.

    "faq.reportContentBody": "You can click the link that says \"report\" on any project, comment, discussion post, studio, or profile page where you see something that isn't ok for Scratch. If the situation is complicated, you can use the {contactLink} link (available at the bottom of every page) to explain. Be sure to include as much detail as you can, with links to relevant pages.",
    "faq.noFlameTitle": "Hvad gør jeg, hvis jeg ser nogen være onde eller respektløse?",
    "faq.noFlameBody": "Lad være med at fyre op under flammerne! At svare på onde kommentarer med endnu mere onde kommentarer vil gøre tingene værre, og kan resultere i at din konto bliver blokeret. I stedet for kan du rapportere alt, som er respektløst eller ikke konstruktivt, og vi skal nok tage det op med forfatteren. Vi undersøger rapporterne hver dag, flere gange om dagen, så vær sikker på, at vi nok skal finde en løsning.",
    "faq.reviewContentTitle": "Hvad gør Scratch teamet hvis noget er rapporteret eller markeret med et flag?",
    "faq.reviewContentBody": "The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account. We may also block the accounts or networks that were used to share it, depending on what was shared and if the person has been sent warnings before",
    "faq.blockedAccountTitle": "Hvad sker der, når en konto er blevet blokeret?",
    "faq.blockedAccountBody": "When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access their account, use it to create projects, or post new comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked, along with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the Scratch {cgLink} in the future, they will be unblocked.",
    "faq.stolenAccountTitle": "Someone got access to my account and got my account blocked. What do I do?",
    "faq.stolenAccountBody": "You are responsible for keeping your password secure. If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsTitle": "Hvad er udvidelser?",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsBody": "In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsTitle": "How do I add an extension to a project?",
    "faq.howToAddExtensionsBody": "If you click on the \"Extensions\" button in the bottom left corner of the Scratch programming editor, you will see a listing of all Scratch Extensions.

You can add multiple extensions to the same project.",
    "faq.createExtensionsTitle": "How do I create my own extension for Scratch?",
    "faq.createExtensionsBody": "The Scratch Team will be publishing specifications and guidelines for extensions in the future. Once available, you will be able to submit extensions to the Scratch Team for consideration in the official Scratch 3.0 extensions library. We’ll also provide guidelines for developing and distributing \"experimental\" extensions, which can be used to create projects on individual computers, but not shared in the Scratch online community.",
    "faq.scratchXTitle": "What will happen to the ScratchX website?",
    "faq.scratchXBody": "The ScratchX website (scratchx.org) was an experimental testbed for extensions. Extensions created for ScratchX are not compatible with Scratch 3.0.

    "faq.newScratcherCloudTitle": "I am logged in, but I cannot use projects with cloud variables. What is going on?",
    "faq.newScratcherCloudBody": "If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables. You need to become a \"Scratcher\" to have access to cloud variables. See the Accounts section (above) for more information about the transition from “New Scratcher” to \"Scratcher\".",
    "faq.multiplayerTitle": "Is it possible to make multiplayer games with cloud variables?",
