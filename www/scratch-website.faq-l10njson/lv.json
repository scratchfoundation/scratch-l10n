Through remixing, creative ideas spread through the Scratch community, and everyone benefits. All projects shared on the Scratch website are covered by the “Creative Commons Share Alike” license, which means that you can remix any project you see on the Scratch website -- and everyone else can remix any of the projects that you share on the website.",
    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle": "Ko darīt, ja es negribu, lai citi remiksē manus projektus?",
    "faq.creativeCommonsBody": "Remixing is an important part of the Scratch community. If you don’t want others to view or remix your creations, you can still create projects on the Scratch website, but don’t share them on the website.",

    "faq.createAccountTitle": "How can I create an account?",
    "faq.createAccountBody": "Just click \"Join\" on the Scratch home page. You’ll need to respond to a few questions, and provide an email address. It takes just a couple minutes, and it’s totally free!",

Once you confirm your account, you’ll be able to share projects, write comments, and create studios. Confirming your account also lets you receive email updates from the Scratch Team. If you cannot find the email with the confirmation link, check your Spam folder. If you still can’t find it, and want to receive another copy, go to your Account Settings, click the Email tab, and follow the instructions there.

    "faq.multipleAccountBody": "It's fine to have a few accounts on the Scratch website, as long as none of them are used to break the {cgLink}. In that case, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted.",
    "faq.multipleLoginTitle": "Vai drīkst vairāk kā viens lietotājs pieteikties vienā kontā?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody": "This is not allowed because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged in to the same account. When an account does something that violates the {cgLink}, all related accounts may be blocked or deleted. If you share an account with someone who does something bad with it, this means your accounts can be blocked for what the other person did.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle": "Vai es varu nomainīt lietotājvārdu?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody": "The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username.

    "faq.noFlameBody": "Neturpini strīdu! Atbildot uz uzbrūkošiem komentāriem ar uzbrukumu visu padarīs tikai sliktāku un var beigties ar to, ka tavu kontu bloķēs. Tā vietā vienkārši ziņo par visu, kas ir necienīgs vai nekonstruktīvs un mēs tiksim galā ar tā autoru. Mēs pārbaudam ziņojumus katru dienu, vairākas reizes dienā - esi mierīgs, mēs tiksim galā.",

    "faq.reviewContentBody": "The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day. If something breaks the Scratch {cgLink}, we will remove it and send a warning to the account.

If someone you know took control of your account and did bad things, tell the adults in charge of the computer they used. If you think someone you don’t know has access to your account, change the password and / or use the {contactLink} link to explain the situation. If your account was blocked for doing something that you did which broke the Scratch {cgLink}, please don’t tell us that someone else did it. When people tell us someone else used their account to do something bad, we then need to try and talk to that person before we can restore the account. This means your account will just stay blocked for a lot longer than if you are honest with us about what happened.",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsTitle": "What are extensions?",
    "faq.aboutExtensionsBody": "In the Scratch editor, you can add collections of extra blocks called \"extensions.\" For example, there are extensions that enable you to program physical devices (such as micro:bit and LEGO robotics kits) and to translate text within your Scratch projects. We will continue to add new extensions over time, so what you can do with Scratch will continue to grow over time. ",

    "faq.newScratcherCloudBody": "If you are still a \"New Scratcher\" on the website, you will not be able to use projects with cloud variables.
